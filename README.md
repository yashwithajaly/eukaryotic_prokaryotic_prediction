# eukaryotic_prokaryotic_prediction
This project aims to predict transcription factors and classify organisms as prokaryotes or eukaryotes using deep learning and machine learning models. It utilizes a hybrid approach combining protein ID patterns, numerical scores, and species data to ensure accurate and generalizable predictions across different species.
